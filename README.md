# simple_weather_program
I created this very simple weather program to exercise loops and arrays in the C programming language. The variable rainfall is a 2D array with numbers of type double that displays the amount of rain for each year and each month. Each row refers to the years (3 rows, so 3 years) and each columns refers to a month (12 months in a years, so 12 columns).

The program then iterates by the years and months and prints out the total rain for each particular year, the total amount of rain for all years, the average rain, the total rain for each particular month, and the average rain for each month. For example, in month 1 (January) for year 1 (2020), the amount of rain was 20.0; for the same month in year 2 (2021) it was 34.0, and for the 3rd year it was 45.0. So the average rain for january was 33.0.

The data was all fictional and it shouldn't be representative of any real-life weather data.
